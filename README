The ProtonMail Bridge is an application for paid users that runs on your
computer in the background and seamlessly encrypts and decrypts your mail as
it enters and leaves your computer. It allows for full integration of your
ProtonMail account with any program that supports IMAP and SMTP such as
Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Apple Mail.
